# Example Project using the ATmega324PB

Are you wondering how to measure frequency or measure duty cycle of a PWM signal? Are you looking how to capture rising edges or falling edges of an input signal? Maybe you need to know how AVR® devices input capture?

This video explains what the input capture module is on AVR devices using the ATmega324PB. The input capture is triggered by the rising or falling edges of an input signal, and then the values are stored in an Input Capture Register (ICR). The resources below show how to measure frequency of PWM using input capture.
