# Example Project using the ATmega324PB

This video explains what Two Wire Serial Interface (TWI), or I2C, communication is. This is shown using an ATmega324PB and includes example code below. TWI or I2C is a form of serial communication that is supported on many ATmega products and allows AVR® microcontrollers to communicate serially with other microcontrollers, sensors and other devices. This includes a data line, SDA, and a clock line, SCL. 

Two advantages of TWI or I2C serial communication are that it uses less pins than other serial communication protocols and it allows many devices to connect to the same data line. The AVR MCU protocol is compatible with the NXP I2C or Two Wire.

If you like the I2C Arduino protocol tutorials, but want to know what the I2C protocol is, this will explain the I2C protocol, or TWI protocol, in a lot more detail. 

This video also links to a TWI tutorial, or I2C tutorial, using Atmel Studio and communicating with a temperature sensor on an ATmega324PB Xplained Pro evaluation board.
