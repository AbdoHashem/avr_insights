# Example Project using the ATmega324PB

Are you looking how to reduce power in your microcontroller? Have you thought of disabling the clock to unused peripherals? The AVR MCU power reduction registers do just that! This video and code tutorial will show you why and how you can shut off the clocks to most peripherals so that they do not use power during your application. The example will also show how to disable the power reduction registers to demonstrate their power saving ability.
