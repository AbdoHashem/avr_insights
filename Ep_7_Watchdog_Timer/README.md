# Example Project using the ATmega324PB

Do you know how to use a AVR Watchdog timer? The avr watchdog timer can prevent code getting trapped in loops. Do YOU want to prevent runaway code using the AVR WDT? You can also learn how to perform a system reset on an AVR device using a timer.

This video shows the three modes of a watchdog timer, and multiple example code snippets showing how to use a watchdog timer. Learn how to set the Watchdog Timer to wake the device from sleep mode when it catches a problem. The AVR watchdog timer can also be used to time certain sections of your program and generate an interrupt if it lasts longer than expected. Check out the example code below to see the lessons learned in the video using official example code.
