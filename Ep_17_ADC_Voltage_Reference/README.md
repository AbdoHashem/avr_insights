# Example Project using the ATmega324PB

Learn why an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) voltage reference would change, and what the AVR voltage reference options are. For example, do you need to change the voltage level that your Analog to Digital converter currently triggers at? 

This video explains the voltage references used for ADC measurements on the AVR MCU, and briefly explains why you would use different references.  The ADC voltage reference is used to set the point at which an Analog read changes from 1 to 0. It can also read the max distance between two inputs that you choose to connect to the ADC. Make sure to check out the example project below.
