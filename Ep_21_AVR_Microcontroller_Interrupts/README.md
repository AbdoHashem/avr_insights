# Example Project using the ATmega324PB
(This is an example project using the Watchdog Timer in an interrupt-based approach and is the same example as episode 7)

Learn about AVR interrupts! If you have a project using an AVR® microcontroller that needs to only trigger after an event or action occurs, then check out this video explaining AVR interrupts! Interrupts give the AVR MCU special instructions only to trigger when certain things happen, helping to decrease power and improve the reaction time of the microcontroller.

Learn the overview of AVR interrupts and their different configuration options. The video explains the Interrupt vector taken, and the minimum response time (4 clock cycles) for an interrupt. The global interrupt enable bit is an important bit to enable in order to keep interrupts working properly. Check out the example below using a Watchdog timer and interrupts.
